                            When you decide to start a business in South Carolina, there are a number of business entities to choose from. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, which we will introduce to you here. Prospective business owners should consult with professionals, such as a business attorney and accountants, before making the final decision. But educating yourself about the different types of corporations can help you assess what is the right business structure for you beforehand.

                            But first, are you ready to incorporate? It is advised that you should incorporate when you anticipate taking investments or when your business approaches material size or complexity.
                        </p>
                        <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                            Typically, “material size” means a business with revenue above $100,000. Once you know you’re ready, you have the option between choosing to classify your business as a C corporation or an S-Corporation. While S corps used to be the way to go for small businesses, thanks to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, C corps are now often recommended for smaller businesses due to lower corporate tax rates. Now, S-Corps are sometimes advisable for larger businesses. But keep in mind that C-Corps give you more options to expand and raise money, which can be very beneficial to a larger business. You may want to discuss the differences with a financial advisor or lawyer who can help break down all of the costs to help you assess what will work best for you.
                        </p>
                        <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                            Whether you choose to structure your business entity as a South Carolina C-corp or South Carolina S-corp will determine how much you’ll pay in taxes, the ways you’re permitted to raise money, and the ease with which you can expand as your business grows. The standard and most common type of corporation is a C-Corporation. In fact, a C-Corp is the default type of corporation. When you initially incorporate, your company will become a standard C-Corp, and only after you file the necessary forms can you be classified as an S-Corp for federal tax purposes.

                        How do you know which type of corporation you want to register your business as when they are both so similar? Both types of corporations offer owners protection from individual liability, so shareholders (and directors, officers, and employees) are typically not personally responsible for business debts. C corps and S corps require similar paperwork. In addition, both are owned by shareholders, have a Board of Directors with annual meetings, and are managed by executive officers. It is also a requirement that both types of corporations pay annual fees, set up bylaws, and issue stock. Basically, an S corporation is the legal equivalent of a regular C corporation. Both have the same rights. They just pays taxes differently.

                        But why opt for a C-Corp? What are the benefits of setting up your South Carolina business as a C-Corp?
                    </p>
                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        The main difference between a South Carolina C-Corp and a South Carolina S-Corp is that a C-Corporation is a legal entity whose profits are taxed separately (under subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code). The corporation’s profits will be taxed at the entity level and then again at the personal level if it’s distributed as shareholder dividends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        There are advantages to a South Carolina corporation formation. Registering as a C-Corporation offers you:

                            No restrictions on ownership. C corporations can be owned by any other legal entity, foreign or domestic. Plus, the company can continue to exist even if the owner leaves the company.
                        </li>
                        <li class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                            The opportunity to issue shares of stock to increase the value of your business. Unlike an S corp that permits only 100 shareholders, there is no limit for C-Corps. Additionally, a C-Corp has no limits on who or what can be a shareholder (meaning other businesses can be shareholders).

                            More potential customers if you one day decide to sell your C corp. C-Corps can be owned by other corporations, LLCs, or trusts, while an S corp can’t be owned by a C-Corp, other S corps, LLCs, general partnerships, or most trusts.

                            Tax-deductible business expenses such as medical reimbursement plans and premiums for health, long-term care and disability insurance (as long as the fringe benefits are equally available to all employees), while S corps do not. Individual shareholders in S-Corps can deduct their expenses from their income but at the same time have to declare these same benefits as income.

                            Rewards if your C corp donates to charity, as C-Corporations are the only type of business entity that can deduct 100% of charitable contributions, as long as the donation doesn’t exceed 10% of the business’s total income.

                            A little more flexibility when starting a business. It will be easier to grow the business, expand the ownership, or sell your corporation.

                            Corporate status, which means shareholders, directors, and officers are protected from sharing liability as long as there is no evidence of fraud or other misdeeds.

                    </ul>
                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        But there are a few disadvantages to starting a C-Corp. One of those is double taxation, as revenue is taxed at the company level and again as shareholder dividends. Additionally, shareholders can't deduct losses on their personal tax returns. But overall, the benefits far outweigh the setbacks, and a C corporation is an excellent choice for many entrepreneurs looking to start a business in South Carolina.

                            Next, figure out who the Registered Agent for your C-Corp should be. The State of South Carolina requires every C-Corporation in the state to have one. This enables the state to ensure the delivery of legal mail and that court documents can be tracked appropriately. The Registered Agent will also act as the contact point between your C-Corp and the Secretary of State’s office. Once you assign someone as your Registered Agent, they can receive official correspondence and documents on behalf of your business.

                            A Registered Agent can be either an individual who is a resident of South Carolina or a business entity that is authorized to conduct business in the state (but not your own business). This can be you or someone else within your company, but keep in mind that this person will be through whom the state has contact with your business. This agent will receive legal documents (known as “Service of Process”) that pertain to your business.Your Registered Agent’s information would go on your most important South Carolina Secretary of State corporation forms.

                        Although the most comfortable option for a Registered Agent would be to name yourself, a friend, or a family member, know that this information will be public record. Not only will the information be searchable on South Carolina’s Secretary of State website, it can also be republished on other sites as well. If you work from home and would much rather keep your home address private, this might not be the best choice. An alternative you can look into is hiring a <span class="italic">South Carolina Commercial Registered Agent Service</span>. While there are a variety of commercial South Carolina Registered Agent Services, for your convenience, we also offer a Registered Agent Service for a small charge that you can include as an add-on to your shopping cart.

                            To create a C corp in South Carolina, you will also need to register your business by filling out and submitting the Certificate of Incorporation - usually called the Articles of Incorporation in other states. The Certificate of Incorporation is a form that should be filed (and maintained) with the state of South Carolina. It establishes the basic elements of the corporation, such as the name and address of the corporation, the number and classes of stock, and certain indemnification provisions. Prior to filing, the South Carolina Certificate of Incorporation must be signed by each incorporator in order to authenticate it. The document can be repealed or amended with the approval of the Board of Directors.

There is no set criteria for what your bylaws should look like, but typically, they should set forth internal rules and procedures for your C corporation. Basically, bylaws are rules of operation that create the company’s structure, ensuring that employees, shareholders, and executives are in the loop about how the business will be run.

                            Key points are covered in the corporate bylaws document, such as when annual meetings will be held, the size of your Board of Directors, and how this form will be amended if need be. In addition, member duties are explained and solutions to common disputes between parties are offered. Voting rights and salaries are discussed, and “what if” scenarios are presented. Having bylaws allows you to set up a structure that works for your business’s unique needs instead of adhering to default regulations within the state.

There is no set criteria for what your bylaws should look like, but typically, they should set forth internal rules and procedures for your C-Corporation.

                            South Carolina law requires one or more director(s). The Board of Directors, while they are not involved in the daily tasks of running a business, represent or govern the corporation. Their duties include handling finances and fulfilling legal requirements, as well as determining the mission of the company.
                        </p>
                        <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text GDF-steps_modal_info">
                            People who do not work for your company can be a part of your Board of Directors. In fact, many businesses turn to lawyers or other business owners to fill in a spot on their Board of Directors. That way, they receive outside expertise from them, plus they may come with their own additional business contacts.

                        These board members must adhere to something called “the duty of loyalty,” which means that directors and officers of a C corporation can only make decisions without any personal economic conflict. The duty of loyalty is breached if something like a self-interested transaction occurs or a business opportunity is stolen. Plus, there is also the “duty of care” to consider. Members of the Board of Directors must make decisions that are in the best interests of the corporation at all times. For example, making a decision that causes serious losses for the shareholders would mean they are in violation of their duty of care--and they can be sued for this.

                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        Your board members will have to hold meetings to make important decisions, such as issuing shares or amending something in the Certificate of Formation. The Board of Directors typically receives equal voting rights (some states, like Delaware, are an exception) when making these decisions. During the first meeting of the C corporation's Board of Directors, directors can appoint officers, decide on bylaws, select a corporate bank, and more. All subsequent meetings must be held annually, though, of course, if more are needed, more can be held.
                    </p>
                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        Minutes of the meeting, which is the recorded documentation of what was discussed or what happened during a meeting, must be recorded to exhibit transparency in business operations, but they do not need to be filed with the state. Instead, these should be kept with your other corporate records, such as Certificate of Formation and bylaws. These documents should be saved for at least seven years in order to protect your company.

                            Shareholders and directors only have the ability to make decisions as part of a group, after holding group meetings and taking votes. An individual shareholder or director does not have the power to do anything - if there are multiple shareholders and directors. If a corporation has only one shareholder or director, the decision-making, of course, falls on that person without the need for a group meeting. Officers, on the other hand, do not operate in groups. An officer holding the position of president, chief executive officer, or treasurer, for example, is an agent of the corporation and has the authority to act on behalf of the corporation on his or her own. Within smaller C-Corps, directors are sometimes also officers and shareholders. In that case, even though the same person is serving in multiple roles, each role has very different responsibilities and is treated as such.

Officers are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company. An officer can be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.

                            One of the benefits of having a C-Corporation is being able to issue shares of stock to raise funds for your business. Shares represent the amount of money invested by the shareholders in the company. Issuing stock to your shareholders allows you to finance your business without relying on debt. Unlike taking out a business loan, you do not pay interest that eats at your profits each month. The value of your business assets can be assessed by taking a look at what amount of your business assets are owned by shareholders vs. lenders. Corporations that have a higher proportion of the company owned by lenders makes an investment in the business appear riskier. If shareholders do invest in your business and purchase stock, keep in mind that if your business fails, you would have to pay back your loans and shareholders.

                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        While there are many advantages to issuing stock, keep in mind that shareholders have an ownership stake in the company. This means that they have certain rights, such as the ability to participate in voting and the assurance that they will be collecting dividends. Profits will be shared and decisions will have to be made in unison. The more stock you issue to shareholders, the smaller your ownership in the business (and the less of a say you have in business major business decisions). On the plus side, when your business grows, you can buy out the other shareholders and get your ownership back.

                        Issuing stock is not a requirement for C corporations, but a privilege that you can make use of if you choose. Doing so can help you fund your business if you are growing and have large, expensive projects planned in the near future. In that case, you can decide how much capital you need and figure out how many shares you’d like to issue and at what price per share. You will already have a number for how many shares you have to offer (that was decided when you filed your Articles of Incorporation). To properly assess the accurate value of each share, determine your company’s net worth first. This will help you figure out what percentage of ownership you believe each share is worth. The appointed Board of Directors can issue stock whenever and to whomever, as long as the recipient has a brokerage account and is over 18 years old.

                        C-Corp shareholders have the option between different levels of stock which offer them varying levels of influence within the company. The stock classes are:

                        The one thing that can limit you here is if you’ve chosen to classify your C corp as a private corporation. This is typically a smaller corporation where the stock isn't offered to the public. A public corporation is authorized to sell their stock to the public, while a private company can’t trade its share on public stock exchanges. But a private corporation is not always small. Many big companies are privately held--such as Dell, Koch Industries, Deloitte, and Cargill. It can be harder for private corporations to raise funds, but it can be important in order to maintain family ownership.

                        Whoever your corporation may sell stock to, it’s important to have a shareholder agreement for protection. This would explain the shareholder’s rights and voting power within the C corporation. You will want to decide and let you shareholders know what kind of say they have in the organization or management of the company when they are issued stock.

                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        The best part? C corporations have no shareholder limit. Only when the company reaches $10 million in assets and 500 shareholders, there is an additional requirement that involves registering with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Securities Act of 1933 and The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are federal securities laws that you must be in compliance with when issuing shares. These laws can be complex and detailed for a new business owner, and you may want to involve a lawyer if you are planning to issue corporate stock. Like most states, South Carolina requires an annual shareholder meeting.

                            A C-Corporation is taxed as a separate entity and must report any profits or losses on a corporate tax return. C corps pay taxes at the corporate level. They report and pay income taxes only on what they are paid by the corporation. A disadvantage is that they also may encounter double taxation if corporate income is distributed to business owners as dividends (these are are considered personal income). Tax on corporate income is paid first at the corporate level and again at the individual level on dividends. The corporate income tax rate for traditional (C) corporations is 5% on all South Carolina taxable income.

                            While most states require an Annual Report, a South Carolina corporation doesn’t have to file an Annual Report unless it elects to be taxed as an S corp. Still, it would greatly benefit you as a business owner, to decipher all gross receipts, dividends, interest, losses, etc., and keep track of all South Carolina S corp fees.

                        Many new C corporation owners begin with their savings to fund their new business venture. If your savings are not enough, you may need to look into liquidating your personal assets or use them as collateral for loans. Can you sell your property or refinance your home? Do you have a retirement account such as a Traditional or Roth IRA? Usually, you can withdraw contributions you made to your IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free, but that is not always the case. Find out what kind of fees your particular retirement plan will hit you with before using your IRA to fund your business.
                    </p>
                    <p class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                        Next, look into whether you know someone who shares your passion for your business and has the ability to contribute financially to your dream. These personal connections may want to support your startup idea. Although accepting an informal loan from a close friend or relative may feel safe, you should still protect yourself in case your relationship with the friend or family member goes sour. Have an official contract drawn up that all parties agree to. You can choose to have it notarized and have witnesses present for extra protection.

                            If you prefer not to borrow from friends and family, you can turn to a peer-to-peer (P2P) or social lending website. A P2P site is a place where investors seek out alternative opportunities to invest outside of stocks and bonds. You can apply for a loan and investors can decide whether or not they wish to fund your proposed business through interest-based loans. You can also look into crowdfunding, which is a way for small businesses or startups to raise money online through donations. These options typically require the ability to promote your business well, ensure complete transparency of where the funds go, and sometimes, the possibility of giving up ownership of a piece of your business. Make sure you look into all of the specifics.

                            You might be hoping to rely on a conventional loan from a bank, credit union or other lending institution for your main source of funds. In this case, you would need a formal business plan to present during your loan application process. If approved, you would be required to sign a legal contract, or a <span class="italic">Promissory Note</span>, outlining your obligations to the lender (which would primarily entail regular payments until the loan is paid off). If you are a first-time business owner, it is likely that you may be rejected initially. In that case, you can improve your application and reapply, or look into alternative sources of funding such as short-term financing via credit cards.

                            Using a credit card as a means of obtaining a fast and easy business loan would grant you use of immediate funds without the hassle and paperwork of loan applications or business plans. This is the best option for a brand new business, and we work with Nav to give our customers access to the credit they need.

                            There are many credit cards that have low or no annual fees, low introductory interest rates, and other rewards depending on your spending. But be careful: make sure you pay back your credit card before the promotional low interest rate expires and skyrockets, or prior to having to pay large annual fees. And don’t make large purchases that can take years to pay back. For example, getting an equipment loan to purchase a piece of equipment is smarter than putting it on a credit card. Credit cards can be a good temporary solution if your business plan will allow you to pay back the debt quickly.

                            Another option at your disposal is a government-sponsored grant or loan program. Traditional lenders can turn to federal, state, or local governments to finance their business if such a grant or program is available. Typically, these programs consider sponsoring specific type of businesses or certain business owners, so be sure to research what government-sponsored loan your particular business or you might be eligible for.

                            Lastly, you can invite people to your team. C-Corporations may have a single person as the company's owner, or an unlimited number of shareholders participating in the ownership of the business. If you could see your businesses strategy succeeding with a partner or multiple partners, pool together your financial resources with another member to support your startup. An advantage to this funding option is your partner(s) may come with their own social network of business contacts and possibly even their own potential investors. To protect yourself, you can adjust your bylaws and ensure that you are still the primary owner of your South Carolina C-Corporation.

                            Creating a website for your South Carolina business is not a requirement but it is recommended to any business owner operating in the modern world. An online presence is important to have and maintain in order to ensure that your customers trust your company and know they will receive good customer service. Having a website gives your business legitimacy; your customers will visit your website and see that you are a real company with an actual website where they can read about the company’s origin and products/services and access contact information. Being able to read up on a company on their website leads to trust between a consumer and an organization. Also, dependable customer service is often offered through a website. By offering an email address, a contact form, and/or live chat with a representative on your website, you are making it easy for a customer to get connected with someone knowledgeable about the product/service. That allows a customer to know that there is a real person who cares about their satisfaction within the company that they are doing business with.

                        But websites needs maintenance too. You can’t simply have one created and never update it throughout the years. Policies and terms change, companies grow, products/services improve, and all of that (and more) can be reflected on the website. This keeps your customers up-to-date and offers a personal touch that is valued by any consumer.

An online and/or social media presence can also lead to responsive customers who can offer you feedback on how you’re doing—plus, it’ll help get your company’s name out there.

You can employ a web agency to monitor your website and/or a social media marketing agency to manage your social media campaign. A social media campaign is a coordinated marketing plan that can assist you with your business goals, which translates into extra advertising for your new business. Marketing your company can help you have a more profitable business and can aid you with paying back your business loans quicker—something any business owner aims for. Regardless of industry, all businesses should consider having a website as part of the first steps of starting a business.

                            If you’ve decided that you want to have a website for your business, keep a few things in mind. When coming up with a website name, make sure that the domain contains your business name and is easy to type and remember for future visits. If you come up with a great web domain that you’d like to use for your business but you don’t plan to create a business website today, you may want to buy the URL to prevent others from acquiring it.

                            While brainstorming website URLs for your website, you’re going to either realize that you already know what your business is going to be named or that you have no idea what or how to name your business. Here are a few quick South Carolina corporation name tips:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="GDF-steps_modal_list">

                                <span class="GDF-bold_text">Follow C-Corp naming guidelines.</span>
                                A corporation’s name usually has to include words, like Corporation, Incorporated, Company, or Limited; or abbreviations, like Corp., Inc., Co., or Ltd. It’s also important not to use any words or phrases that will make it easy for someone to mistake your company for a federal agency; think “State Department.”
                            </li>
                            <li class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                                <span class="GDF-bold_text">Find a unique name.</span>
                                If you’re getting a C corp in South Carolina you will need an original name that is not in use by another corporation. To check if a name has already been taken, you can try the <a href="https://businessfilings.sc.gov/BusinessFiling/Entity/Search">South Carolina Name Availability Database</a>. If you are not ready to file a C-Corp in South Carolina today but want to reserve a name in the meantime, you can do so by filling out the form (and paying a $25 fee) here. This puts a hold on the name for 120 days.
                            </li>
                            <li class="GDF-steps_modal_text">
                                <span class="GDF-bold_text">Make sure it is available as a web domain.</span>
                                This way, you can find out if another company outside of South Carolina has a corporation with the same name. In that case, think of something more original.

                            Once you become an official South Carolina corporation, make sure you keep your C corp compliant. Remember all important dates and make all necessary payments on time. Know all of the laws regarding the issuing of stocks. Host all necessary annual meetings. This is mandatory if you don’t want your new business to run into any issues. If you’d rather not do these tasks yourself, you can sign up for a service that will automatically send you alerts ahead of crucial state and federal filing deadlines. Likewise, you can hire an accountant, a tax professional, and/or an attorney to ensure you are not making errors when keeping records, filling out paperwork, and making payments.
